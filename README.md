# The Maven Review

Here we propose an updated methodology of a 2-tiered collaborative review process of scientific analyses for large collaborations, such as LHCb. The proposal is based on the [current model used by LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/lhcb_page/collaboration/organization/editorial_board/Publication_Procedure-Sept2011.pdf) and aims at improving in several points.

## The aim of the proposal
We try to adress three issues that are a recuring problem with the current review process:
1. Feedback on the strategy and technique of the analysis has to be made available to the analysts as early as possible. Few things are as wasteful and frustrating as when someone works for quite some time on a project but gets feedback that requires substantial changes only once the analysis is finished and thought to be ready to be published. 
2. 

The proposal presented here adresses all of these issues while preserving the essential and valuable features of the present review process, in particular the requirement that an analysis is reviewed by independent minds.
