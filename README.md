# The Maven Review

Here we propose an updated methodology of a 2-tiered collaborative review process of scientific analyses for large collaborations, such as LHCb. The proposal is based on the [current model used by LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/lhcb_page/collaboration/organization/editorial_board/Publication_Procedure-Sept2011.pdf) and aims at improving in several points.

## The aim of the proposal
We try to adress three issues that are a recuring problem with the current review process:

1. Feedback on the strategy and technique of the analysis has to be made available to the analysts as early as possible. Few things are as wasteful and frustrating as when someone works for quite some time on a project but gets feedback that requires substantial changes only once the analysis is finished and thought to be ready to be published. 
2. Currently the only basis for a review is the analysis note. The actual tools to obtain the results are largely absent from the discussion. This makes it very hard to ensure the reproducibility of the result and the sustainability and relevance of the work invested for future projects. 
3. To make best use of the limited available resources, feedback has to be well structured. In most cases it is straight forward to request a large number of cross checks and systematic studies. It is less obvious how the available time is spent most usfully. There are two issues connected to this: the ability of the reviewers to ask the right questions, based on the material presented to them; and the priorisation of tasks, possibly requiring triage if the collaboration wants to hit a particular deadline.

The proposal presented here adresses all of these issues while preserving the essential and valuable features of the present review process, in particular the requirement that an analysis is reviewed by independent minds. In fact most actions proposed -- with one exception -- do not touch on the content of the current publication procedure. Instead we try to flesh out some crucial details of the early stages of the review process in the working groups.
